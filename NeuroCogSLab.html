              <p><strong>Research interests: </strong><font style="font-size:0.9em"> Speech comprehension is a dynamic and context-sensitive process. I use neuroimaging to understand how cortical analysis of language adapts to different contexts, goals and social environments. I am also deeply interested in using current neuroimaging methods for assessment, early diagnosis, and remediation of developmental and acquired disorders of language.</font><strong><a href="#Research"> All current projects </a></strong></p>

              <strong>Research interests:</strong><font style="font-size:0.9em"> I have a deep passion for developmental and cognitive neuroscience and the intricacies of brain development from infancy to early childhood and adulthood. I studied Psychology (BSc) and Neuroscience (MSc) at the University of Granada (Spain), joined the University of York as a Research Assistant (2021-2023) and am now a PhD student in the University of Aberdeen. My work focuses on the development of Executive Functions and its neural substrates during infancy, specifically Attention and Working Memory during the first 3 years of life.  My PhD is focused on the interplay between music training, speech processing, and cognitive functions, with a practical goal of understanding how music training can also help children with their reading abilities.</font>

                  <h3>Goal oriented language processing</h3>
                  <p><strong>The aim of this research strand is to understand how cortical language processing at multiple levels (perceptual, lexico-semantic and syntactic) is shaped by the listener’s/reader's communicative goals. Addressing this question is key to updating current models of cortical language analysis. To address this question, we use EEG and naturalistic story listening/reading.

                  <h3>Music and Reading</h3>
                  <p><strong>The goal of this project is to relate reading performance in young readers (5-7 year olds) to their neural signatures of speech and music processing, music training and key executive skills. We will explore the hypothesis that musical training can facilitate cortex-to-music and cortex-to-speech entrainment and have beneficial effects for reading skills. In the long term this work will help to develop intervention tools for stimulating normal phonological awareness in children who struggle with reading.

                  <h3>Human-Model-Priming</h3>
                  <p><strong>This is a collaborative project between the Computer Science and Psychology Departments in the University of Aberdeen.  The key purpose of this study is to compare syntactic priming effects generated by human participants to that in AI systems that model language processing (such as Large Language Models - LLMs). We plan to understand the extent to which LLMs can learn to encode structure in language and whether resulting representations are similar to the human ones. Project collaborators: <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/arabella.sinclair"> Dr Arabella Sinclair</a>, <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/people/agnieszka.konopka"> Dr Agnieszka Konopka</a>, <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/anastasia.klimovich-gray">Dr Anastasia Klimovich-Gray</a>, <a href="https://www.abdn.ac.uk/psychology/people/profiles/nika.adamian/">Dr Nika Adamian</a>. Funders: Aberdeen University, Internal Funding to Pump-Prime Research and Research Networks to all collaborators. </strong></p>
                  <h3>Neural2Speech</h3>
                  <p><strong>The goal of neural2speech is to build a multimodal contrastive neural network model trained on both neuroimaging input (fMRI and MEG) and speech output. Can we use tools of deep learning to accurately decode speech content from neural brain activity?  Addressing this issue is critical for restoring communication in people with speech motor impairments. At the same time, assessing the quality of the perceived speech from brain recordings can provide better understanding of specific linguistic processes affected by a given impairment and provide clinical neuroscience with invaluable assessment tools.
